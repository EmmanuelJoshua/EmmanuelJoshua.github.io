                        are part of
                        the team which helps the Host to manage, run and host Events. Organizers have special access
                        privileges and
                        are invited to access and use Raven Livestream by a Host.</p>

                        specific Event by a Host or have signed up for a Raven Livestream account and attend an event
                        using their
                        account details. “Participants” also include Participants that have been invited by the Host as
                        a guest to
                        speak or perform at an Event, exhibit at an Event, or be Event sponsors.

                        any content
                        produced or activities carried out during an Event, for the conduct or Contributions (as defined
